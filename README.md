# Collaborative Code Editor

This code editor was built to address the following needs:
1. Create a code editor designed for real-time collaboration. 
2. Build beginner tools for git versioning and code review.
3. Design a user interface similar to Google Docs to reduce information overload and introduce concepts in a familiar way.

We used the Firepad API, CodeMirror, Google Polymer's LitElement, Java Servlets, App Engine Datastore, Firebase Realtime Database, and more in the creation of this product. Feel free to check us [out](http://step-collaborative-code-editor.appspot.com/).

Created by Grace Luo, Max Friedman, and Valentino Dore.
